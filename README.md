To Get Started
Step-1 Download and extract the zip file    
Step-2 go to dist folder
step-3 run the GUI.exe


Note: Sometime firewall may not allow gui.exe to be downloaded and run if thats the case you may need to override it through the firewall(due to missing certificate) and if it still doesnt run you will have run the GUI.py to check the code.
enjoy😁
